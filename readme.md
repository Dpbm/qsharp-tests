# Testing Q\#

In this repo, you'll find some code using Q# that I did to understand this language better.

Most part of it was done during I was studying theses courses and materials:

- [Get started with Azure Quantum](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals/)
- [Quantum Curriculum](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum-curriculum-preview/)
- [Quantum Katas](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas)
